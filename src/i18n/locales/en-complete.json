      "description": "ESEC gathers data from various software license servers, end points and hardware systems, providing secure, near real-time reports, dashboards, and alerts. ESEC is set up at the customer's location, where access to the information is limited to designated employees. ESEC delivers hundreds of reports and dashboards to help organisations efficiently manage software and hardware assets and make timely decisions. This ensures that productivity of the assets and the users are optimized to get the best ROI. Senior management often require customised reports and updates; our expert consultancy ensures these needs are met effectively. In addition, based on customer's requirement we add new features (if technically feasible) at no cost. This enables not only to meet the customer expectations but also enhance ESEC product capabilities on a continuous basis."
